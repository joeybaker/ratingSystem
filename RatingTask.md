# Build a rating system 
Design a rating system that will be used to rate restaurants. You should define:
* The basics of the UI
* The basics of the API
* The DB schema

## Basic requirements
* use a nosql database.
* build a CRUD interface.
* your UI should use backbone.

## Tips
* have an understanding of performance
* its ok to have only two resturants
* rating can be just a score; comments aren't necessary
* dont worry user accounts, but ensure multiple ratings are averaged together
* the design isn't important. We're looking for how you build.
* tests are good!
  
Good luck, dont worry about finishing.
